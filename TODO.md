# TODO: Implement Dummy News for Homepage

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Modified `getIndonesiaNews()` in `thestoryapi-source.js` to always return dummy data from `mock-news.js`
- [x] Ensured the homepage news section displays dummy news without API calls
- [x] Updated news section colors from blue to brown theme colors in `styles.css`

## Summary
The homepage news section now uses dummy data exclusively and has been styled to match the website's brown theme. The `getIndonesiaNews()` method has been updated to directly return the mock news articles, bypassing any external API fetches. The CSS has been updated to use brown color variables (--primary-color) instead of blue colors for the news section borders and links.
